<h1>The Best Movies Acccording to Moyin</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2><hr/>
<h3>Dali & Cocky Prince</h3>
<p>The movie is a rom-com korean movie. I love how each character portrayed their role beautifully</p>
<h3>Orange Is the New Black</h3>
<p>It is a series. It gets really agitating but you can't just stop watching. It displays the life of different people in the prison and how things work around there.It is basically a story of different women struggling with their lives in prison and also on how they navigated and solved whatever problem they encountered.

<h3>A tribe of Judah</h3>
<p>This movie is one of my most favorite Nigerian movie. It is so funny and it will probably be the highlight of your week if you watch it. </p>
